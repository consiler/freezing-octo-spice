Notes August 10, 2013
Normally cons. have PAs where they organize both their content - function and industry
this is how we did it with solutions'
but actually creaint MM and an IAC which is none other than corporate athlate / n-holon / maslows thing 
vitruvian man - microcosm of macrocosm
  so there is some matching pattern in the da vinci drawing and that means that you are balancing your resonance (you are like a tuning fork)

When you come into the site:
  ??? location of consilient pitch
  if were going 2 do a dogwhistle sort of search like beacon for your brand where if you want to tune in to our conversation you can
  so under Purpose & Performance PA you put Integral Development Plan
  see n-dim wholon that is you, show CA with article, or consilient athlete
  pyramid is sitting therre
  ask "how many layers do you perceive?"
  were walking machines, that's confusing the map for the territory, know there's no way to get off the map of concept
  clinging to the rational layer, have to get them off of there (def. of being unenlightened, previous age in Spiral Dynamics)
  Body - Mind - Spirit CA backstory
    how to unlock consilient content
      have video interview "what aspacts are you aware of?" - my music self, I was in a band, he had an out of body experience playing their last show, he does experience a lot of energy from music, normally what I want to do with tai chi is to explain yin and yang and parimedes, this starts to get us off the rational layer, to the energy layer, in real life, the IDP, this is the content that gets unlocked, think of Gempo Roshi, Max

  Pyramid, Layers of it
  It's our meme map, and we show that... in this section
  We back up to Live Dialog, and there's this other aspect that we could present to you if you clicked "what is energy?"
  Doctor is still missing that Energy can still heal
  the PAs are the n-dimensional wholon that is you, and all the content can be organized off thagt
    We're looking for a way to unlock functionality
    Back to psychographic sharing we don't care where we enter the conversation
    We could suggest to this doctor that Energy healing, mindfulness healing, and expose him to this kind of belief
    We believe Zen is a really useful tool for not confusing the map with the territory
    We have a Zen Master, Qi Gong master, Tai Chi master, and 
    Science is like information is the latest metaphor but we're always revising our reality
    If we're swimming ideas we help you choose and embody wordmaps and you are a flow or a direction, not really a thing, just like the universe is not a thing, but why are you not a thing?
    Reality won't be the same, everything's going to be different, identifying the world of form, the world of impermaence, 
    We perceive the reality as information-theoretic but entiryely consistent with classical views of excellence (china, greece)
    Gong Fu - is actually excellence, the practice of excellence, it's a way of life, it's a "strengthen your mind through your body"
    Body Mind Spirit = Great Chain of Being (Lack of separation, MIT (study: name for the perennial tradition called "great chain of being, growth from depth to subtle, and there's an energy center for the body, it's the center of gravity, the body center, beyond that is "))

    Basically, use the corporate athlete concept to present the website.
    Mindfulness is healing becausde of harmony of the three treasures 
    and that could be a bit somewere
